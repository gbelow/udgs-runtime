This is a creation and game running tool to facilitate fallowRPG games.

## Code Style & Patterns
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use 'use client' directive for client components
- Prefer const/let over var

## Project Structure
- Components should be in app/components/
- Types should be centralized in app/domain/types.ts
- Schemas parse json data in a best effort/lossy way. Only values with matching type and name get loaded into the Character objects.


## React/Next.js Patterns
- Use React 19 patterns
- Prefer server actions for data mutations
- Use client components only when needed

## Game-Specific Guidelines
- Maintain consistency with existing game mechanics (afflictions, penalties, skills)
- Follow the character/weapon/armor data structure patterns
