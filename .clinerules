This is a creation and game running tool to facilitate fallowRPG games.

## Code Style & Patterns
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use 'use client' directive for client components
- Prefer const/let over var

## Project Structure
- Keep game data in JSON files in the app/ directory
- Components should be in app/components/
- Types should be centralized in app/types.ts
- Use the event bus pattern (eventBus.ts) for cross-component communication

## TypeScript Conventions
- Use type inference where possible
- Export types from app/types.ts
- Use typeof for JSON-derived types (like CharacterType, WeaponType)

## React/Next.js Patterns
- Use React 19 patterns
- Prefer server actions for data mutations
- Use client components only when needed

## Game-Specific Guidelines
- Maintain consistency with existing game mechanics (afflictions, penalties, skills)
- Follow the character/weapon/armor data structure patterns
